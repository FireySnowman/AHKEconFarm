# AHK Econ Farm
 
Hello fellow Comrads and Capitalists, I am here to present to you an updated version of a exciting opportunity. A fully automated script that will work the economy bot while you are away from your computer. The process is simple, provided you have a Windows PC.

As for the script itself, every time it goes through the work cycle, it will cost 42 units of our currency, a flat fee. This can work to your benefit, as if you earn larger amounts you don't have to pay as much as compared to if it was going by a percent system.


## Instructions:
There are two methods for running AHKEconFarm. The first is the easiest, but you do have to run a exe file that I made. So depending on how much you trust me, this may or may not be an option for you. Don't ever run exe files from people you don't trust.

The second method is by downloading AutoHotKey and running the source code through that. This is the safer option as you can look at the code and know that there isn't anything fishy.

### EXE Method:
 1. Download the EXE on the [latest release](https://github.com/NullCub3/AHKEconFarm/releases/latest)
 2. Locate the download
 3. Run the "AHKEconFarm_v1.x.exe" file
 4. Click "OK" on the pop up informing you that the program is now running
 5. Select chat box
 6. ???
 7. Profit!!!


### Source Code Method:
 1. Download and Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
 2. Download the source code of the [latest release](https://github.com/NullCub3/AHKEconFarm/releases/latest)
 3. Locate and unzip the download
 4. Run the "AHKEconFarm.ahk" file
 5. Click "OK" on the pop up informing you that the program is now running
 6. Select chat box
 7. ???
 8. Profit!!!
> Note: You can't really use your computer while this is running, as all this really does is just type in the chatbox for you.
